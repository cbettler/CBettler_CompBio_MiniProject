# CBettler_CompBio_MiniProject
The overall goal of this code is to resequence E. coli K-12 strains that have evolved over time, which were derived from the original E. coli K-12 sequence that was sequenced in 1997. 

To run this code, you must download/pull the miniProjectCompBIO3.py file, or copy its contents into a command line text editor (such as nano or vim), which then must be saved as miniProjectCompBIO3.py. Once you have the file downloaded, you can run it from the comnmand line using:
python3 miniProjectCompBIO3.py 

All outputs from this command will be found in the OptionA_Carlee_Bettler directory it creates, and certain outputs will be written to a logfile called OptionA.log. Please note that running this code requires downloading and installing the software/commands of TopHat2, Cufflinks, BowTie2, SPAdes, Prokka, SRA-Toolkit (for fastq-dump), Python3, and wget. Be aware, the TopHat command is particularly slow, running this code may take over three hours. Also, all files pulled with the wget command come from NCBI.
