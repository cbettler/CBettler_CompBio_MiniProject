# CBettler_CompBio_MiniProject
The overall goal of this code is to resequence E. coli K-12 strains that have evolved over time, which were derived from the original E. coli K-12 sequence that was sequenced in 1997. 

To run this code, you must download pythonCode.py from this repository, which can be ran from the command line using:
python3 pythonCode.py

All outputs from this command will be found in the OptionA_Carlee_Bettler directory it creates, and certain outputs will be written to a logfile called OptionA.log. Please note that running this code requires downloading and installing the software/commands of TopHat2, Cufflinks, BowTie2, SPAdes, Prokka, SRA-Toolkit (for fastq-dump), Python3, and wget. Be aware, the TopHat command is particularly slow, running this code may take over three hours. Also, all files pulled with the wget command come from NCBI.
